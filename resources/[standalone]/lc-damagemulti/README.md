## lc-damagemulti

Super simple client side script that you can either put into your smallrescources or just drag and drop this into your resources folder and ensure it :)

## How to make damage multiplier work
Locate your desired Weapons.meta file, and edit the following
```bash
<HeadShotDamageModifierPlayer value="18.000000" />

You would change it to like

0.0165000

then the body damage is the 

<Damage value="38.000000" />

Obviously change that to whatever you'd like a body shot to do.
```
