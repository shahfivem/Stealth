This project includes code derived from the following LGPLv3-licensed project:
- [Overextended Library](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) 

The initialization code (e.g., `init.lua` and `resource/init.lua`) contains code derived from ox_lib components that perform similar functions. Certain modules, such as the Callback, Points, and RegisterCommand modules, to name a few, also contain code derived from ox_lib. The coding styles and safe practices of the Overextended team have been, to my project's betterment, applied throughout.
