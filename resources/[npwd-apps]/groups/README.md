# !!WIP!!
## This is the V2 of my original groups script.

[DOCUMENTATION](https://devyn-docs.vercel.app/)

This script aims to replace and improve on my first iteration of a group handler.
Still working on it but the base is there with working UI.
To use the built in UI navigate to config/shared.lua and set `standaloneUI = false` to `standaloneUI = true`
There is also an npwd app I've made ( also still a WIP ) [npwd_groups](https://github.com/darktrovx/npwd_groups)

This script is currently setup to work with [Qbox](https://github.com/Qbox-project) and [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)

If you want to also use the reputation system you need [Reputation](https://github.com/darktrovx/reputation)

This update has no backwards compatibility and any existing group scripts will not work with it.
