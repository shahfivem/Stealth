# Lonf | Cemetery robbery

I made a cemetery robbery using ox_lib for Qbox, but you can modify one thing or another and make it work.

The Script has some functions that work according to the game's time, for example if it's early in the morning there's a chance that some goths will spawn and attack you, or if it's daytime the police will probably be alerted and if you have Even better luck, a priest with a shotgun will run after you. Another thing I did was sell the items, which is in the north.

I will be very happy if you share a new idea, an exploit, or any tips for better coding.
Feel free to make your modifications.

Another thing, there is an "install" folder that contains the items that are placed in ox_inventory\data\items.lua and also has the images that are to be placed in ox_inventory\web\images

To do the sales part I used Kevin's ped sales script, I ended up editing some things and adapting it to my needs, so thank you very much Kevin :)
